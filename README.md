## Features

     ```

   - Connect the app to your Firebase project:

     ```bash

## Firebase Configuration

The Notes app utilizes Firebase for data storage. To connect your own Firebase project, follow these additional steps:

1. **Create a new Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).**

2. **Obtain your Firebase configuration:**

   - Go to Project Settings in the Firebase Console.
   - Under the "Your apps" section, select the web app.
   - Copy the configuration object.

3. **Replace the Firebase configuration in the app:**

   - Open the `src/firebase.js` file.
   - Replace the existing Firebase configuration with your copied configuration.

Now, your Notes app will be connected to your own Firebase project.
